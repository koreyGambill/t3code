# Thread workspace

Open **Workspace** in a started conversation or search for **Open workspace** in
the command palette. It keeps questions, action items, design explanations, and
catch-up notes beside the conversation. Groups can nest, and an item's short
reference stays the same when it moves.

Ask the agent to **workspace this for later** when you want something saved.
The agent can organize and update the board without stopping its other work.
Ordinary chat does not populate the board automatically. The Workspace badge counts
unanswered questions and unfinished action items. Section tabs show their item counts.

## Questions and action items

Questions can offer one choice, several choices, or a written answer. A recommended
choice shows the agent's advice. It is never selected on your behalf.

Your answers and action notes save as you work and stay private from the agent
until you send them. **Add to chat** places one response or all ready responses in
the composer, with readable answers and references back to the workspace items.
Review or edit the draft, then send it. Completed action items are ready to add
even without notes. If saving fails, your draft remains available to retry. A
conflicting edit from another device needs resolving before you add responses.

Action items hold outstanding needs and future work. Mark one done or reopen it
without starting an agent run. Add it to chat when you want the agent to act on
its status or your notes.

## Agent work and QA

**Agent work** keeps the work an agent takes on, what changed, and how to try it.
Choose **All threads and machines** to review work across connected environments,
including archived and settled conversations. Each entry links back to its thread.
Disconnected machines show that their work could not be loaded.

Filter by pending, passed, or issues. Mark an item passed or record issues and save
a QA note. You can return it to pending later. QA notes are shared with the agent.
Finished work waits for your QA separately from the agent's completion status, so
pending QA does not stop routine work or authorized landing.

Verification entries distinguish a run by another thread from the implementing
thread's own report. Source review stays labeled as source review, with the tested
revision, evidence, and remaining gaps when supplied.

## Design and summary

Design holds the agent's explanations, context, diagrams, and documents. Ask for
changes in chat. Summary covers the whole conversation so you can catch up on
what happened, what changed, and the current state. Future work belongs in Action
items.

## Child preamble

The **Record** tab has a **Child preamble**: standing instructions added to the
task of every delegate this thread starts, such as which checkout to use or which
checks to run. The child sees it marked as coming from this Workspace, and the
delegate's own task wins where they differ. Native subagents and new threads do
not receive it, and no conversation history is copied. You can also ask the agent
to set it.

## Marks and related threads

Marks collects links from chat, keeping each URL's first appearance. Search,
filter, sort, and choose columns before copying. **Copy all** produces plain-text
rows using your visible columns and current results. The agent can add a link
description when useful.

Threads shows related conversations and why they matter. The clock in the chat
header opens **Recent Threads**. Back and Forward follow your navigation path.

## Context marks

Ask your agent to save a finished turn as a named context mark in Workspace,
then start workers from that mark. Each mark keeps its original conversation
point when the source thread continues. Workers can share that point and still
use separate checkouts. Reviews start with fresh conversation context unless
you ask them to inherit a point.

The worker's Lineage shows its context source and whether it received a native
fork or portable conversation context. A busy source or a different provider
uses portable context, which can omit older history to fit the context budget.
Files stay at the worker's checkout state. The worker receives a summary of
file changes since the marked point when its snapshot is available.

## Personal notes

Personal notes are yours. Choose a notes directory for each environment to save
thread notes as Markdown files. Preview the current Markdown draft without sharing it.
Notes remain private until you select text and
add it to the composer, then send it. You can include the T3 thread ID in the file. The note includes a
terminal resume command when the provider has a resumable session.

Workspace is available in web and desktop builds with workspace support. An
older connected environment needs a build with support before it can serve the
panel.

## Inspect: loads and token usage

Open a right-panel tab and choose **Inspect** for Loads and Tokens.

Loads shows file reads, skill loads, and related tool activity observed in the
conversation. Use Refresh to update these views while an agent is working. Reported events and events inferred from command text are labeled
separately. A command mentioning a file does not prove every byte reached the
model, and an unavailable tool result has no invented token count.

Tokens shows the usage the provider reported for each turn, including cache
accounting when available. Instruction sizes are a separate estimate from the
actual application payload prepared for a turn. They break down T3 instructions
by section, application context, and custom prompt additions. Estimates use
UTF-8 bytes divided by four. They are not billed token counts, and they should
not be added to the provider's totals.

Hidden provider harness instructions remain unknown. Earlier turns without an
instruction snapshot stay unavailable rather than inheriting today's prompt.
